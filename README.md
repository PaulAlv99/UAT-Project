# UAT-Project
Project of Paulo Alves and Francisco Afonseca for Ubiquitous applications technologies
1º npm install and then npm start in the backend aka cd Backend
2º change the IPV4 that appears in the .env.. you should create a .env in both FrontEnd and BackEnd. In the BackEnd with JWT_SECRET,JWT_EXPIRES_IN,PORT,MONGO_URI. In the other .env aka FrontEnd should be EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL,EXPO_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL,EXPO_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY
2º using Android Studio, cd FrontEnd, use npm i (not sure about this one) and then npx expo start, but first we need to start the emulator on the device manager or use your own device using expo go.
